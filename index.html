<p class="subtitle">Ithaca High School offers a plethora of technology-related classes through its Math and Tech departments, ranging from AP Computer Science to Engineering Design and Development to Digital Media I and II. Many of the classes, such as Engineering Design and Development, are offered through the Project Lead the Way program.</p>
<p id="compsci" class="nodisplay" class="subtitle"><b>Computer Science:</b>
Ithaca High School’s Math Department offers three computer science courses. Since the courses concern computers, devices that are today inseparable from technology, the courses are effectively technology courses.
<p id="pr12" class="nodisplay">Programming I and II are two semester-long classes that typically taken in succession. They are designed to prepare students to take AP Computer Science (although many students have successfully skipped to the AP level). Programming I teaches students basic programming in Java, covering objects, classes, and events, as well as basic command structures (if, else, while, etc…). At the end of the course, students embark on a final project, typically programming a game such as Battleship. In Programming II, the class takes a technical turn; students learn why what they programmed in the previous course works to a greater depth. In fact, the class is only a small step away from AP Computer Science.</p>
<p id="apcomp" class="nodisplay">AP Computer Science is a year long course and a continuation of what students have learned in previous programming courses, with an emphasis on preparing students for the AP Computer Science AP exam in May. Students learn about classes, inheritance and polymorphism, program design and testing, strings and arrays, recursion and analysis and efficiency of algorithms.</p>
<p id="pltw" class="nodisplay"><b></b>Project Lead the Way:</b>
Project Lead the Way, or PLTW, is an organization that aims to provide high-quality technology education to students, preparing them for the global economy. It designs the curriculum for a myriad of classes, typically taken in succession, which involve diverse tech-related classes taken by many Ithaca High School students.
<p id="ddp" class="nodisplay">Design and Drawing for Production is generally the first class students take in the succession in 9th grade. It’s focus is to provide students with knowledge of computer aided design, using Autodesk Inventor, along with an introduction to engineering. Students in the class begin by learning how to do technical drawing by hand before moving to computer aided design. Additionally, students can gain college credits—and one of Ithaca High School’s required Fine Arts credits by taking the class. A girls-only variant of the class is offered so that girls do not have to be in a male dominated class (although the class is in fact less popular with girls than its counterpart).</p>
<p id="cim" class="nodisplay">Computer Integrated Manufacturing is typically taken next. Students learn about the relation between computers and manufacturing, using a CNC router in projects like making coasters. Additionally, students use parts from VEX Robotics competitions to build robots that help to automate manufacturing parts of the course.</p>
<p id="de" class="nodisplay">The next two courses in the PLTW sequence, taken concurrently, are Digital Electronics and Principles of Engineering. In Digital Electronics, students learn about applied digital logic and Boolean logic. In Principles of Engineering, students learn all about engineering and the career opportunities it can provide. The course focuses on the question  “Is a career in engineering or engineering technology for me?”</p>
<p id="edd" class="nodisplay">Finally, students can take the flagship course of PLTW—Engineering Design and Development. Students in the course design and build a solution to an engineering problem. During this school year, students have built a robot used to gather ecological data about Ithaca’s local Cayuga Lake. The students’ design is an enormous improvement over the past design.</p>
<p id="mc" class="nodisplay"><b>Media Production:</b>
Ithaca High School offers several courses relating to the production of media of many forms.</p>
