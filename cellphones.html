		<h1>Cellphones</h1>
		<p class="techTypeContent">Improper disposal of cell phones places the environment and humans at risk. Throwing cell phones in landfills instead of responsibly recycling them allows harmful chemicals, such as mercury and lead, to leach into soil and groundwater and create a slew of environmental consequences.
</p>
		<p class="techTypeContent">Cadmium, which is present in semiconductors of cell phones, stunts plant growth when it seeps from cell phones into the environment. Lead, another chemical commonly found in cell phones, causes cancer in many animals, as well as neurological problems, population decline, and impaired organ development in fetuses. Some cell phones contain as much as two grams of mercury, which damages the brains of animals. 
</p>
		<p class="techTypeContent">These harmful effects may become even worse because of biomagnification as chemicals travel through the food chain.
</p>
		<p class="techTypeContent">Harmful substances in cell phones impact humans as well as the environment, particularly when they leak from groundwater to municipal water supplies. When exposed to cadmium, humans experience an increased risk for cancer, kidney stones, and neurological problems. Moreover, a study in the International Journal of ChemTech Research suggested that cadmium can lead to birth defects. 
</p>
		<p class="techTypeContent">Lead, which is officially classified as a hazardous substance, is a carcinogen. It’s also notorious for lowering birth rates and IQ and impairing organ development in fetuses.
</p>
		<p class="techTypeContent">Mercury, which is found in cell phone circuit boards, is extremely damaging to the brain. Mercury is especially harmful when it combines with methane to become methylmercury, which can also cause blindness and impaired muscle tone. Mercury also causes respiratory and skin disorders when exposed to humans. When cell phones are put into landfills, all of these harmful chemicals can affect human life.
</p>
		<p class="techTypeContent">The harmful effects of improper e-waste disposal have led to some laws to regulate disposal of cell phones and other electronics. This legislation makes it illegal to throw any electronic equipment in the trash, and violations can result in a $5,000 fine.
</p>
		<p class="techTypeContent">So, before dropping your cell phone in the trash can, consider the environmental and medical—not to mention legal—ramifications of your actions.
