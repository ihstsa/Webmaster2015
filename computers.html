	<h1>Computers</h1>
	
	<p class = "techTypeContent">When computers are burned or thrown into landfills, they release substances that seriously harm the environment and human health. When computers are put in landfills, chemicals such as lead, cadmium, and mercury seep into the environment.
</p>
	<p class = "techTypeContent">Lead, which is present in computer circuit boards, can cause cancer in animals and decreased birth rates. Lead causes a variety of other harms, including neurological problems, decreased birth rates, and improper organ development in animals.
</p>
	<p class = "techTypeContent">Cadmium, a chemical found in computer semiconductors, stunts the growth of plants. It can also lead to birth defects. Mercury, which is found in computer circuit boards, causes serious neurological issues in plants.
</p>
	<p class = "techTypeContent">Improper disposal of computers in landfills harms ecosystems as a whole, in addition to individual plants and animals. When people dispose of melted computer chips on the ground, their substances lead to soil acidification, which can harm many species of plants.
</p>
	<p class = "techTypeContent">The burning of computer housing and other plastic pieces containing PVC produces dioxin, a compound that causes reproductive problems and damage to the immune system. Additionally, the beryllium in in motherboards sometimes causes berylliosis (chronic beryllium disease), which causes rashes, coughs, and chest tightness, and skin problems among other symptoms.
</p>
	<p class = "techTypeContent">These harmful effects on human health, especially when conflated with the carcinogenic and neurological effects of lead, mercury, and cadmium mean that improper disposal of computers can harm humans in the extreme.
</p>
	<p class = "techTypeContent">In addition to resulting in negative consequences regarding health and the environment, improper disposal of computers is illegal in New York State. The NYS Electronic Equipment Recycling and Reuse Act of 2010, makes it illegal to throw away any electronic equipment. Failure to comply with this law results in fines up to 5000 dollars.
