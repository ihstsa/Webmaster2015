    <div id="batteries" class="section">
    	<p class="text">Batteries contain heavy metals and electrolytes, which react with each 
    	other to produce electrical energy. When people dispose of batteries incorrectly
    	by throwing them in the trash or putting them in landfills, these substances
    	can contaminate nearby soil and groundwater.</p>
    		
    	<p class = "techTypeContent">In the soil, toxic chemicals can be extremely damaging to the environment. 
    	Cadmium can stunt the growth of plants, while mercury, which is also present
    	in batteries, has been proven to damage animals’ neurological functions. Lead,
    	another substance in batteries, harms a population’s birth rates. In areas with 
    	higher concentrations of lead, most organisms, including humans and sea otters, 
    	experience fewer births and increased risk of developing cancer.</p>
    		
    	<p class = "techTypeContent">Eventually, these toxic chemicals can trickle through the food chain, harming 
    	many animals and plants, and possibly the humans who consume them. Toxic chemicals
    	can also reach humans by seeping from groundwater into municipal water supplies.</p>
    		
    	<p class = "techTypeContent">A study at Carnegie Mellon University concluded that humans exposed to too high 
    	levels of cadmium have an increased risk of developing cancer, neurological 
    	problems, and kidney stones. Worse, a study in the International Journal of ChemTech
    	Research added birth defects to this list of troubles.</p>
    		
    	<p class = "techTypeContent">Humans, especially infants and children, are highly susceptible to neurological
    	and behavioral damage when they are exposed to lead. Lead can also cause spontaneous 
    	abortion and higher rates of stillborn children. While scientists aren’t sure if the
    	amount of lead in batteries is significant enough to cause these problems
    	single-handedly, the risk is present—and it’s a risk that nobody wants to take.</p>
    		
    		<p class = "techTypeContent">Although the 1996 “Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act”
    		phased mercury out of many batteries, some batteries (including button-cell batteries)
    		still contain mercury. In humans, mercury is extremely damaging to the
    		brain—especially when it combines with other elements to become methylmercury—where it
    		can also cause blindness, more neurological problems, and impaired muscle tone.</p>
    		
    		<p class = "techTypeContent">New York State has taken measures to mitigate the harmful effects of battery
    		disposal. Improper disposal of batteries in New York State can result in fines of up
    		to 5,000 dollars, adding a material reason to dispose of batteries correctly. For all
    		New Yorkers, disposal of rechargeable batteries as solid waste has been illegal since 
    		December 5, 2011. </p>

    <div id="cameras" class="section">
    	
    	<p class="techTypeContent">When cameras are thrown away in landfills, the chemicals they contain harm the environment and the health of humans who are exposed to them. 
</p>
    	<p class="techTypeContent">Cameras can contain a variety of toxic chemicals, including lead, mercury, and cadmium. Lead, which is found predominantly in camera circuit boards, contaminate surface and groundwaters, as well as soil. As a result, this lead travels through the ecosystem and harms animals’ birth rates, while creating an increased risk for cancer. In addition, when lead leaches into groundwater, it produces the toxic chemical phosphor. Mercury attacks the central nervous system and endocrine systems, and harms the neurological development of fetuses. When it diffuses into water, the mercury becomes methylmercury, which becomes even more of a risk as concentrations build up throughout the food web. Cadmium, which is used in soldering and semiconductors, poses a risk to the environment in that it is possibly carcinogenic and damaging to multiple organs in animals.
</p>
    	<p class="techTypeContent">The chemicals in cameras harm human health as well as the environment. For instance, lead harms a range of body systems, from the nervous system to the reproductive system. It is also a carcinogen and can cause seizures, neurological problems, high blood pressure, and birth defects. Mercury harms the nervous and endocrine systems and potentially hinders the correct development of fetuses. Cadmium damages the lungs, liver, the brain and kidneys. 
</p>
    	<p class="techTypeContent">In addition to causing negative environmental and health effects, the improper disposal of cameras can result in legal repercussions. 
</p>
    	
    </div>
        
    <div id="phones" class="section">
    	
    	<p class="techTypeContent">Improper disposal of cell phones places the environment and humans at risk. Throwing cell phones in landfills instead of responsibly recycling them allows harmful chemicals, such as mercury and lead, to leach into soil and groundwater and create a slew of environmental consequences.
</p>
		<p class="techTypeContent">Cadmium, which is present in semiconductors of cell phones, stunts plant growth when it seeps from cell phones into the environment. Lead, another chemical commonly found in cell phones, causes cancer in many animals, as well as neurological problems, population decline, and impaired organ development in fetuses. Some cell phones contain as much as two grams of mercury, which damages the brains of animals. 
</p>
		<p class="techTypeContent">These harmful effects may become even worse because of biomagnification as chemicals travel through the food chain.
</p>
		<p class="techTypeContent">Harmful substances in cell phones impact humans as well as the environment, particularly when they leak from groundwater to municipal water supplies. When exposed to cadmium, humans experience an increased risk for cancer, kidney stones, and neurological problems. Moreover, a study in the International Journal of ChemTech Research suggested that cadmium can lead to birth defects. 
</p>
		<p class="techTypeContent">Lead, which is officially classified as a hazardous substance, is a carcinogen. It’s also notorious for lowering birth rates and IQ and impairing organ development in fetuses.
</p>
		<p class="techTypeContent">Mercury, which is found in cell phone circuit boards, is extremely damaging to the brain. Mercury is especially harmful when it combines with methane to become methylmercury, which can also cause blindness and impaired muscle tone. Mercury also causes respiratory and skin disorders when exposed to humans. When cell phones are put into landfills, all of these harmful chemicals can affect human life.
</p>
		<p class="techTypeContent">The harmful effects of improper e-waste disposal have led to some laws to regulate disposal of cell phones and other electronics. This legislation makes it illegal to throw any electronic equipment in the trash, and violations can result in a $5,000 fine.

    <div id="computers" class="section">
    	
    	<p class = "techTypeContent">When computers are burned or thrown into landfills, they release substances that seriously harm the environment and human health. When computers are put in landfills, chemicals such as lead, cadmium, and mercury seep into the environment.
</p>
	<p class = "techTypeContent">Lead, which is present in computer circuit boards, can cause cancer in animals and decreased birth rates. Lead causes a variety of other harms, including neurological problems, decreased birth rates, and improper organ development in animals.
</p>
	<p class = "techTypeContent">Cadmium, a chemical found in computer semiconductors, stunts the growth of plants. It can also lead to birth defects. Mercury, which is found in computer circuit boards, causes serious neurological issues in plants.
</p>
	<p class = "techTypeContent">Improper disposal of computers in landfills harms ecosystems as a whole, in addition to individual plants and animals. When people dispose of melted computer chips on the ground, their substances lead to soil acidification, which can harm many species of plants.
</p>
	<p class = "techTypeContent">The burning of computer housing and other plastic pieces containing PVC produces dioxin, a compound that causes reproductive problems and damage to the immune system. Additionally, the beryllium in in motherboards sometimes causes berylliosis (chronic beryllium disease), which causes rashes, coughs, and chest tightness, and skin problems among other symptoms.
</p>
	<p class = "techTypeContent">These harmful effects on human health, especially when conflated with the carcinogenic and neurological effects of lead, mercury, and cadmium mean that improper disposal of computers can harm humans in the extreme.
</p>
	<p class = "techTypeContent">In addition to resulting in negative consequences regarding health and the environment, improper disposal of computers is illegal in New York State. The NYS Electronic Equipment Recycling and Reuse Act of 2010, makes it illegal to throw away any electronic equipment. Failure to comply with this law results in fines up to 5000 dollars.</p>

    	<p class="techTypeContent">Improper disposal of televisions harms the environment and human health. Putting televisions into landfills instead of responsibly recycling them leads to harmful chemicals, such as mercury and lead, seeping into soil and groundwater. All of these harmful chemicals can also reach humans, especially as polluted groundwater contaminates municipal water supplies.
</p>
	<p class="techTypeContent">When introduced to the environment, these harmful chemicals result in countless negative consequences. According to a study Carnegie Mellon University, plants experience stunted growth from cadmium poisoning. Another study suggested birth defects as additional effect of cadmium on animals.
</p>
	<p class="techTypeContent">Lead, another chemical commonly found in televisions, causes cancer in many animals, as well as neurological problems, population decline, and impaired organ development in fetuses. Mercury, which is found in the circuit boards of televisions, is extremely damaging to the brain. It also causes blindness and decreased muscle tone.
</p>
	<p class="techTypeContent">The harmful environmental effects of substances found in televisions can be projected to human life as well. For instance, cadmium exposure causes an increased risk for cancer, kidney stones, birth defects and neurological problems in humans. 
Lead, which is officially classified as a hazardous substance, is a carcinogen often present in televisions. Lead is also notorious for lowering birth rates and IQ and impairing organ development in fetuses.
