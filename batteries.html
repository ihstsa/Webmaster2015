    		<h1>Batteries</h1>
    		<p>Batteries contain heavy metals and electrolytes, which react with each 
    		other to produce electrical energy. When people dispose of batteries incorrectly
    		by throwing them in the trash or putting them in landfills, these substances
    		can contaminate nearby soil and groundwater.</p>
    		
    		<p>In the soil, toxic chemicals can be extremely damaging to the environment. 
    		Cadmium can stunt the growth of plants, while mercury, which is also present
    		in batteries, has been proven to damage animals’ neurological functions. Lead,
    		another substance in batteries, harms a population’s birth rates. In areas with 
    		higher concentrations of lead, most organisms, including humans and sea otters, 
    		experience fewer births and increased risk of developing cancer.</p>
    		
    		<p>Eventually, these toxic chemicals can trickle through the food chain, harming 
    		many animals and plants, and possibly the humans who consume them. Toxic chemicals
    		can also reach humans by seeping from groundwater into municipal water supplies.</p>
    		
    		<p>A study at Carnegie Mellon University concluded that humans exposed to too high 
    		levels of cadmium have an increased risk of developing cancer, neurological 
    		problems, and kidney stones. Worse, a study in the International Journal of ChemTech
    		Research added birth defects to this list of troubles.</p>
    		
    		<p>Humans, especially infants and children, are highly susceptible to neurological
    		and behavioral damage when they are exposed to lead. Lead can also cause spontaneous 
    		abortion and higher rates of stillborn children. While scientists aren’t sure if the
    		amount of lead in batteries is significant enough to cause these problems
    		single-handedly, the risk is present—and it’s a risk that nobody wants to take.</p>
    		
    		<p>Although the 1996 “Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act”
    		phased mercury out of many batteries, some batteries (including button-cell batteries)
    		still contain mercury. In humans, mercury is extremely damaging to the
    		brain—especially when it combines with other elements to become methylmercury—where it
    		can also cause blindness, more neurological problems, and impaired muscle tone.</p>
    		
    		<p>New York State has taken measures to mitigate the harmful effects of battery
    		disposal. Improper disposal of batteries in New York State can result in fines of up
    		to 5,000 dollars, adding a material reason to dispose of batteries correctly. For all
    		New Yorkers, disposal of rechargeable batteries as solid waste has been illegal since 
    		December 5, 2011. </p>
