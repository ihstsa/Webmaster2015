<p class="subtitle">The proper disposal of electronics and batteries takes time and effort, but from environmental and legal standpoints, the investment is worth it. Electronics and batteries contain substances that pollute the ecosystem and place plants, animals, and even humans at risk. Laws that seek to forestall and mitigate these harmful effects provide yet another reason to ensure the proper disposal of batteries, cell phones, computers, and televisions.
<br>
Batteries contain heavy metals and electrolytes, which react with each other to produce power. When people dispose of batteries incorrectly, the heavy metals—which in some cases include cadmium and lead—can contaminate the nearby soil and groundwater. The polluted groundwater sometimes contaminates municipal water supplies. When humans drink this water and are exposed to toxic chemicals such as cadmium and lead, they may experience brain and kidney damage, an increased risk for cancer, and more. In the soil, toxic chemicals, including cadmium, can stunt the growth of plants. Eventually, these toxic chemicals can trickle through the food chain, harming many animals and plants and possibly reaching humans.
<br>
The improper disposal of cell phones, computers, and televisions can also contaminate groundwater and soil. For example, melted computer chips disposed of on the ground can lead to soil acidification. The beryllium in in motherboards sometimes causes berylliosis (chronic beryllium disease), warts, and other disorders. The burning of computer housing and some other plastic pieces, which contain PVC, produces dioxin, a compound that causes reproductive problems and damage to the immune system. Some cell phones contain as much as two grams of mercury, which contributes to brain and kidney damage through exposure. These negative effects on the environment, the ecosystem, and human health illustrate the undeniable dangers of improper disposal of electronics.</p>
<p id="legal" class="subtitle">The improper disposal of electronics and batteries does not only have harmful effects on organisms and ecosystems; it also has legal repercussions. In New York, disposal of rechargeable batteries as solid waste has been illegal since December 5, 2011. Another New York legislation, the Electronic Equipment Recycling and Reuse Act of 2010, makes it illegal to throw away any electronic equipment, including computer, cell phones, and televisions. Failure to comply with either of these laws results in fines up to 5,000 dollars.
