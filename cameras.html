    	<h1>Cameras (a work in progress)</h1>
    	
    	<p class="techTypeContent">When cameras are thrown away in landfills, the chemicals they contain harm the environment and the health of humans who are exposed to them. 
</p>
    	<p class="techTypeContent">Cameras can contain a variety of toxic chemicals, including lead, mercury, and cadmium. Lead, which is found predominantly in camera circuit boards, contaminate surface and groundwaters, as well as soil. As a result, this lead travels through the ecosystem and harms animalsâ€™ birth rates, while creating an increased risk for cancer. In addition, when lead leaches into groundwater, it produces the toxic chemical phosphor. Mercury attacks the central nervous system and endocrine systems, and harms the neurological development of fetuses. When it diffuses into water, the mercury becomes methylmercury, which becomes even more of a risk as concentrations build up throughout the food web. Cadmium, which is used in soldering and semiconductors, poses a risk to the environment in that it is possibly carcinogenic and damaging to multiple organs in animals.
</p>
    	<p class="techTypeContent">The chemicals in cameras harm human health as well as the environment. For instance, lead harms a range of body systems, from the nervous system to the reproductive system. It is also a carcinogen and can cause seizures, neurological problems, high blood pressure, and birth defects. Mercury harms the nervous and endocrine systems and potentially hinders the correct development of fetuses. Cadmium damages the lungs, liver, the brain and kidneys. 
</p>
    	<p class="techTypeContent">In addition to causing negative environmental and health effects, the improper disposal of cameras can result in legal repercussions.
