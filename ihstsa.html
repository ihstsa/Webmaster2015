    This is the person who allows IHSTSA to exist. He provides some general direction to the club, especially before officer are elected, as well as an adult. He's all about technology:, teaching several tech classes at Ithaca High School, and building jet engine in his garage. He's one suave man.</p>
    <p class="text"><img class="officer" src="zak.png">Zak Stillman is Ithaca High School TSA's President. His two favorite events are CO2 Dragster and Video Game Design, in which his team took 7th place at the 2014 TSA National Conference. He is also a national three-time finalist in System Control Technology. He’s also a national finalist in Techno-Talk. When he’s not preparing events in TSA or coordinating chapter activities, Zak is a diligent student and a member of Ithaca High School Code Red Robotics (FIRST Team 639) and Ithaca High School’s Debate Team.</p>
