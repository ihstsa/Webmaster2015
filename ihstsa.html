<div id="aboutus" class="section">
	<p class="text">We’re a group of highly motivated students at Ithaca High School who are interested in learning about technology and, really, all of STEM. Every year, we compete in various technology-themed competitions organized by the Technology Student Association in events as diverse as Dragster Design, Webmaster, and Children's Stories.</p>
</div>

<div id="competitions" class="section">
	<p class="text">Zak Stillman’s dragster, codenamed “Winston,” was the fastest dragster at states, and we all have high hopes for it at nationals. It incorporates a shell design, and is planned to be left unpainted—only varnished and meticulously sanded to preserve the natural look of the wood.
</p>
	
	<p class="text">Our chapter’s Video Game Design submission, Tree, is a fast-paced strategy game all about being a tree, involving related topics like photosynthesis and how a tree should grow to get maximum sunlight. To add interest to non-biologists, the designers added the fight against extraterrestrial biocontamination as a plot element. The designers are past Video Game Design finalists and believe it will be one of IHSTSA’s best submissions this year.
</p>
	
	<p class="text">You’re viewing IHSTSA’s Webmaster submission right now, and we hope you like it. An older version of this site won first place at states, and we hope it will fare similarly at nationals. This three-part website is devoted to Ithaca High School’s technology department, the Ithaca High School Technology Student Association chapter, and how and why people should dispose of electronic waste.</p>
	
	<p class="text">At the state conference in April, our Children’s Stories team won first place for the story Battery Low, a futuristic tale that features a girl named Ada and her pet robot. The team has utilized artistic and writing skills and has visited a local elementary school to receive feedback for the work. Our chapter looks forward to participating in this new event in the future.

<div id="fundraising" class="section">
	<p class="text">Because attending TSA national conference is a financial challenge for many families at Ithaca High School, the entire chapter pitches in with fundraising efforts to help every student go. Fundraising is divided into two principal areas: crowdfunding and selling Gertrude Hawk chocolate bars after school.
<br>
<br>
Since 2014, Ithaca High School has used crowdfunding as a way to help send themselves to the TSA national conference. Last year, crowdfunding raised 5,146 dollars on the local PEAKS crowdfunding platform. The campaign was the result of a partnership between Ithaca High School TSA and IthacaSTEM, a non-profit organization that helps Ithaca High School TSA and other local technology clubs. The highlight of the campaign was a video (link) made by Sophia Shi, then the vice-president of Ithaca High School TSA.
<br>
<br>
This year, Ithaca High School launched a similar crowdfunding project, which has raised more than 1,800 dollars and is accompanied by another promotional video.
<br>
<br>
Historically, Ithaca High School TSA has had great success selling Gertrude Hawk chocolate bars in school, but this year has brought a new challenge. This year’s ban on selling chocolate during school has caused us to turn to selling the chocolates immediately before and after school, and profits remain high.
</p>
</div>

<div id="service" class="section">
	<p class="text">Giving back to the community is extremely important for our TSA chapter. Each year, we try to do a community service project that benefits our community and our school. Last year, we worked to clean up Fall Creek, which runs alongside our school, and flows into Cayuga Lake. We spent hours organizing and cleaning, collecting many bagfuls of litter and waste. Not only did we benefit our local community and environment, but we also learned about how to work as a team, and accomplish difficult tasks. A similar community service project is planned for later this year—New York, did after all, have a really long winter.</p>

	<p id="zarky" class="text">Zak Stillman is the president of Ithaca High School TSA. His two favorite events are CO2 Dragster and Video Game Design, in which his team took 7th place at the 2014 TSA National Conference. He is also a three-time national finalist in System Control Technology and a national finalist in Techno-Talk. When he’s not preparing events in TSA or coordinating chapter activities, Zak is a diligent student and a member of Ithaca High School Code Red Robotics (FIRST Team 639) and Ithaca High School’s debate team.
</p>
	<p id="giraffe" class="text">Jacob Silcoff is Ithaca High School TSA’s vice-president, with Video Game Design and Catapult (an event specific to New York State TSA) as two of his favorite events. At TSA Nationals, Jacob has won in Technology Bowl, System Control (with Zak), and Video Game Design (with Zak). Outside of TSA, Jacob is a talented student, snowboarder, and captain of the Ithaca High School debate team. </p>
	
	<p id="winston" class="text">Freya Ryd is the secretary for Ithaca High School TSA. Her favorite events are Video Game Design and Photographic Technology (although she misses Techno-Talk from middle school, in which she was a two-time national finalist). Freya was also part of Zak and Jacob’s winning Video Game Design team. Outside of TSA, Freya enjoys horseback riding and plays the violin. </p>
	<p id="fireball" class="text">Tristan Engst is Ithaca High School TSA’s reporter. His favorite events are Webmaster and Video Game Design (he was part of Jacob, Zak, and Freya’s winning team). At Nationals, he has also won in Technology Bowl (with Jacob). Outside of TSA, Tristan is an illustrious student, a varsity Cross Country runner, and an editor of the school’s newspaper, the Tattler.</p>
	<p id="sophie" class="text">Sophia Shi is Ithaca High School TSA’s Sergeant-at-Arms, as well as New York State TSA’s outgoing president. Sophie has fared well in Essays on Technology, finalizing multiple times. She’s also done an amazing job in her leadership role, effectively transferring her vast amount of TSA knowledge to the other officers, who are slated to be on the officer team next year. Sophia is also a pianist, a violinist, and a tennis player. Next year, she’s going on to New York University to study film.</p>
