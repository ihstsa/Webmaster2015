Ithaca High School uses a modified—secular and shorter—version of the TSA creed. Our motto is also slightly different from National TSA’s, better reflecting technology’s part in TSA.
<br>
Motto: Learning to live in a technological world.
<br>
Creed: I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my life in the technical world. I believe there is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials, experimentation, and processes of industry. Guided by my teachers, members of the industry, and my own initiative, I will strive to make my world a better place in which to live. I will accept the responsibilities that are mine, and theories that are supported by proper evidence. I will explore safer and more effective methods of working and living, and express my ideas to the best of my ability. I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me.</p>

    <p class="text">With many students <b>to poor</b> to easily spend roughly $1,000 going to the TSA National Competition, <b>fundraising is a big part of being in IHSTSA</b>. We fundraise by <a class="bodylink" href="javascript:HideAllShowOne('ch');"><b>selling chocolate bars</b></a> and <a class="bodylink" href="javascript:HideAllShowOne('cr');"><b>crowdfunding</b></a>.</p>
    
    <p id="ch" class="text">Ithaca High School TSA has historically had great success selling Gertrude Hawk chocolate bars in school. Even this year’s ban on selling chocolate has in school hasn’t deterred us from selling the chocolates immediately after school ends, and profits have remained high.</p>
    <p id="cr" class="text">Since 2014, Ithaca High School has used crowdfunding as a way to help send themselves to the TSA National Conference. Last year, $5,146 was raised by crowdfunding, using the local PEAKS crowdfunding platform. The campaign was the result of a partnership between Ithaca High School TSA and IthacaSTEM, a non-profit organization that helps Ithaca High School and TSA and other local technology clubs - such as Code Red Robotics (FIRST Team 639) and the Ithaca High School Science Olympiad. The highlight of the campaign was a video made by Sophia Shi, then Ithaca High School TSA’s vice-president. This year, a similar project is under way.</p>
